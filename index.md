## Research Interest

My research interests are mainly in the field of Machine Learning with a focus on applications of ML techniques to various domains.
Of late, I have also started taking interest in ANNs and Deep Neural Networks because of the intriguing way they 
work and mimic humans in cognitive tasks, especially those related to __Language__.
