## Experience 
---

### **Distant Supervised Relation Extraction | MALL Lab, IISc, Bangalore**

*Jan 2018 - July 2018*

I worked as a research intern in [Machine and Language Learning Lab](http://malllabiisc.github.io/) under the supervision of 
[Prof. Partha Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/). My work was focused on creating a domain specific **Knowledge Graph** in a 
Never Ending Language Learning System (**NELL**). 

I was working to solve the problem of **Relation Extraction** using a novel approach for Distant Supervision. The work resulted in a paper in EMNLP 2018.

### **5G Packets Generator and Analyser| Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore**

*June 2017 - July 2017*

I worked as a summer intern in [Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore](http://www.samsung.com/in/aboutsamsung/samsungelectronics/india/rnd/) as
part of the 5G team under the _Communication protocols_ division.

My work was to create a Packet Generator and Analyze for 5G packets as a tool
for SRI-B employees to easily test and improve the 5G Protocol Stack. The tool consists of a GUI part which allows the user to select scenarios and custom
parameters which are used to generate 5G packets at GBps rates. The different
scenarios generated by the tool act as a *stress test* for improving the 
5G Protocol Stack.

This tool will have direct impact on the development process of 5G, which you
could hopefully see in the market by 2020!

### **DataCube for Uttarakhand | IIRS, ISRO**

*May 2016 - July 2016*

I have worked in [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing](http://www.iirs.gov.in/), [Indian Space Research 
Organization (**ISRO**)](http://www.isro.gov.in/) in the summer of 2016. I was working in the project 
titled "*Development of Datacube for Uttarakhand using GeoSpatial Technologies*".
Our task was to study the techniques of forming a DataCube and create one for ISRO.

A DataCube is a model which can be used to quickly process temporal satellite data to observe _trends_ in various products like Vegetation Cover, Farm Land Use etc.

I was involved in determining the best GIS image storage formats for storing the 
large satellite image data. I was also involved in the preprocessing of the raw 
satellite digital number data to useful products such as Radiance and Reflectance. 

I also modeled the core API and Execution Engines of the DataCube and created 
algorithm templates which could run on the data of the area selected by the 
user on an interactive web portal. 

The code for the DataCube is open source and you can find it on [Github](http://github.com/sharat910/datacube-iirs).

### **BITS LifeGuard | Mentor: [Dr. Rahul Banerjee](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rahulbanerjee/profile)**

*August 2016 - Present*

In [LifeGuard](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/ProjectBITSLifeGuard/Home) we are developing a fault-tolerant, cost-effective smart driver 
safety jacket with real time monitoring of vital signs, to prevent road 
accidents and taking emergency action in the unlikely case an accident occurs.

Currently I'm working on adaptive learning aspects of Body Sensor Networks 
and **Sensor Data Fusion**. My work consisted of literature survey of various sensor
data fusion techniques used in Body Sensor Networks for IOT devices using 
sensor data like GSR, ECG, HR, Respiration, etc.

I am also currently implementing and testing accuracy of various sensor fusion 
algorithms which are based on Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines,
Bayesian probabilistic theory, Hidden Markov Models and finally those 
based on Fuzzy Logic and Decision trees. The accuracy of these models will be 
measured on real-time driving data which will be taken using a simulator built by the team.

### **Distance Iris Recognition | Mentor : [Dr. Kamlesh Tiwari](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/kamleshtiwari/profile)**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

Iris Recognition is a well worked on problem of recognizing people based on
biometric iris data. We worked on a solution for Iris Recognition on 
Distance images (low quality Iris), using the CASIA Distance Dataset.

The model proposed performs well, with correct recognition rates of over
85%, with just preliminary filtering and enhancing 
of the low quality Iris from the distance images. Gabor filters have been used for matching, after extracting the iris data after segmentation.

Future work will involve clearing the database of blurry images of varying
degrees and matching using both the eyes' iris, instead of the currently
used one-eye matching to further enhance the matching accuracy.

### **Ad Effectiveness and their Impact on Sales | Mentor : [Dr. Sangeeta Sharma](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/sang/profile)**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

I was working on correlating Sales with Advertisements to measure the effectiveness of Ads on Sales. 

I used NLP tools on Google Trends as well as consumer sales data correlate the Ads with Sales. 
The Sales data was obtained courtesy [Govt. of India](http://data.gov.in/). 
I also used YouTube comments on Ads to correlate sentiments with the particular Ad to show how more emotional ads have a stronger impact on sales.

### Mini Projects

* **PSO Optimized K-Means** : Studied and implemented Particle Swarm Optimization to improve clustering performance of K-Means Clustering Algorithm

* **Heading Generation using Speech Phonetics** : Created a crawler to obtain clean speech audio and generated a summary and its heading using phonetics and tone of the speaker

* **Parallel BranchAndBound** : Implemented a parallel skeleton for BranchAndBound to solve NP Hard problems on a cluster of workstations. 

* **Compiler for ERPLAG** : Created a compiler in C for a dummy language as part of Compiler course. Implemented the parser and code generator.

* **Network Packet Sniffer** : Created a network packet sniffer to mimic the functions of WireShark to sniff packets and display an analysis of packets being transmitted on the network.

* **One Class Classification** : Used Extreme Learning Machines to solve the problem of Outlier Detection using One Class Classification for Sensor Data.

### **APOGEE MapMyIndia Hackathon | BITS, Pilani**

*April 2017*

Was part of team *TrippyMinds*, which came **1st** in a Machine Learning hackathon 
organized by [MapMyIndia](www.mapmyindia.com/) on [Kaggle](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/mapmyindia2), a famous platform for Machine Learning Contests, for APOGEE, the technical fest of BITS Pilani.

The problem consisted of solving the problem of detecting the speed limits 
of roads from street signs captured in images taken on the highways of India. Our approach consisted of an ensembel of custom trained 
HaarCascade Classifiers running under an ensembel of simple CNNs to 
classify the extracted bounding boxes.

### **DECode Hackathon | HackerEarth**

*October 2017*

Participated and came **3rd** in a Machine Learning hackathon 
organized by D.E. Shaw on [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/de-shaw-de-code/), a famous platform for Machine Learning and Competitive Coding Contests. 

The problem was to predict the Chances of Investment for different users for the Month of July using the data for investments for those users for January to June. I used XgBoost after feature engineering.
